# Project Working steps

## After connecting template engines

1. first make sure that mongo db connected
2. Next step we need to create a database schema in model
   a. open userModel
   b. design the db schema(which includes field names of table and data type)
        ex: user -> fieldName = data type
        name = string
        email = string
        mobile = string
        age = number                
        you can continue the fields depend or requirement
        now we will consider only these 4 fields
